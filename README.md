This repo houses the TeX files and R script to compile my dissertation proposal entitled, "Efficiently Exploring Multilevel Data with Recursive Partitioning.

This proposal used the Classic thesis template by Dr. Andres Miede available [here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/classicthesis-typographic-thesis).
